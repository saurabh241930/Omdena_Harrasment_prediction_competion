# Omdena_Harrasment_prediction_competion
This project is part of my omdena global competition, here we are given an anonymous crime data collected by safecity consist of Lat &amp; long and incident record, I am creating machine learning to predict the safety of region.


Note: So for identifying safety, for 1st problem statement, I tried different types of method, following are some of the highlights of all the method that I have tried and will try to implement in coming weeks

Since many participants are doing the spatial-temporal way of classifying regions into safe or not safe to avoid overlapping Iâ€™m exploring the more unconventional way of classifying, By just using deep learning techniques  & computer vision

 
## Inputs:

So for the inputs(Sattelite image & street image), I used Mapquest(I liked their quality compare to google static images)
